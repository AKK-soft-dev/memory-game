This app isn't that amazing. Just practicing with Bootstrap, trying to optimize performace (such as preventing unnecessary re-renders and unintended re-synchronization) and managing state structures (such as avoiding redundant states). I know this app doesn't need much states but I got some experience with choosing structure of state. Hee...
