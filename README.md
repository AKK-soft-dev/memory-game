# memory-game
Before I talk about this app, I want to tell you that I didn't code by watching tutorials. But I admit that the idea is from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja) youtube channel.

This app isn't that amazing. Just practicing with Bootstrap, trying to optimize performace (such as preventing unnecessary re-renders and unintended re-synchronization) and managing state structures (such as avoiding redundant states). I know this app doesn't need much states but I got some experience with choosing structure of state.
